    <h1>Why travelling is important?</h1>
    <p>Traveling is important for humans. We are communal creatures that are all of the same species, yet our location determines societal actions based off cultured and governmental laws. We are so similar, yet our little worlds are so entirely different. Traveling to see places beyond our hometown is crucial to gain exposure to the world. Whether someone travels domestically or to a foreign country, it can be an experience that is reminisced for a lifetime. Foreign travels may require extra planning such as obtaining a visa. Even if it’s last minute and an individual has no schengen visa appointment, they should still reach out to places where they can obtain one. Traveling should be a happy thing, even if it is just a business trip to another state. It’s important to maintain a continual pattern of learning and awareness throughout one’s lifetime, and traveling is great way to do that.</p>

    <p>Traveling gives us exposure to other cultures. If an individual has remained in their home time for their entire life, it would make it hard to completely understand the struggles and celebrations of other regions and countries. One country can be vastly different from one side to the other. The dialects differ, food, local music, and the terrain can all be different from one place to another. There are different languages and ways of communicating all over the world. Exposure to these things allows us to become open-minded and understand that though we are different, it is our similarities as humans that brings us together. Traveling is great for global humanity.</p>

    <p>Arguably, one of the best things about visiting a new place is the food. Many television shows are dedicated to showing us all about other cultures and the food they eat because food displays many virtues and explains many things about a culture from the local agriculture to necessary imports. Food is traditional, historic, evolving, and something all humans need. Food is a great way to learn about different dishes to incorporate other places. It’s a great way to share cultures with one another.</p>

    <p>Something that traveling demonstrates is the communication and language barriers that individuals may face going to a place. It’s also a great way to understand and learn to appreciate nonverbal communication. When traveling, it is important to learn necessary words the region’s native language such as: hello, goodbye, please, thank you, and bathroom. It is also highly beneficial to learn menu items and restaurant etiquette as it allows individuals a way to order correct food. Learning as much of the native language that one is traveling to is crucial to enjoying a trip with as minimal communication barriers possible.</p>

    <p>One of the great benefits to traveling is the connections that are built, and the relationships made during one’s stay. As humanity is so often divided learning to communicate across nations and foster a global understanding of each other is crucial to the success of all countries and people. Traveling fosters a medium to build human connections with one another by learning about culture, food, new sites, music, and the way people live their day to day lives in different parts of the world. It’s the best on-site learning a person can get. The internet can only explain so much about a place. Even with virtual reality being a new and innovative option to take tours of places, there is still nothing like seeing a new place in person for the first time.</p>

    <p>Traveling is also important for human happiness and mental health. Studies show that traveling can be great for mental health. Living in a world where individuals are constantly slammed with the stress of work, relationships, and maintaining a family, it’s important that they take time to relieve all that stress, so they can continue to function normally. Traveling helps humans gain a greater understanding of themselves to create a feeling of wholeness within their own individuality. This is important, because remaining present is such a hard thing to accomplish sometimes when our brains are saturated with things to stress over and fill our heads with anxious thoughts. Traveling gives individuals the moment to remain present, even if it’s just for a few moments. Traveling can also just make humans happy overall. The pursuit of happiness is arguably the meaning to life. Finding love and happiness is something most humans aspire and yearn for. Traveling can also be a way to build mental resilience. It can be incredibly intimidating to visit a new place, especially if there are language and cultural barriers to overcome. Learning emotional regulation and intelligence in these situations helps build stronger mental health.</p>

    <p>Traveling is many experiences in one. It’s a way to learn and grow within oneself and grow with other people by learning about something or someone new. It’s is a way to hone organizational and time management skills. Traveling is an opportunity to communicate with someone different than ourselves or the people in our region. Through communication and understanding, traveling can provide a way to bring humanity together.</p>
