    <h1><u>Kalimpong</u></h1>
    <p>The first thing that strikes the traveler visiting Kalimpong is its quiet atmosphere. The peaceful ambience that pervades is heightened by the presence of monasteries and churches across the town. Kalimpong is also known for its bustling bazaars and traditional handicrafts.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The etymology of Kalimpong has several interpretations. According to one view, Kalimpong means a place where tribesmen gather and organize traditional tribal games. The second view suggests that the name has been derived from a place in Bhutan. A third interpretation is that Kalimpong is named after Kaulim, a fibrous plant found in abundance in this region. Until the 18th century AD, Kalimpong was a part of the Kingdom of Sikkim and was ruled by Sikkimese rulers. It was then taken over by the Bhutanese. In the 19th century, the British took over Kalimpong and merged into the present Indian state of West Bengal.</p>
