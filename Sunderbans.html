    <h1><u>Sundarbans</u></h1>
    <p>Sundarbans, formerly Sunderbunds, vast tract of forest and saltwater swamp forming the lower part of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga])-Brahmaputra River delta in southeastern West Bengal state, northeastern India, and southern Bangladesh. The tract extends approximately 160 miles (260 km) west-east along the Bay of Bengal from the Hugli River estuary in India to the western segment of the Meghna River estuary in Bangladesh and reaches inland for about 50 miles (80 km) at its broadest point. A network of estuaries, tidal rivers, and creeks intersected by numerous channels, it encloses flat, densely forested, marshy islands. The total area of the Sundarbans, including both land and water, is roughly 3,860 square miles (10,000 square km), about three-fifths of which is in Bangladesh.</p>
    <h2>Sundarbans National Park</h2>

    <p>Sundarbans National Park, large natural area in extreme southeastern West Bengal state, northeastern India. The park, created in 1984 as a core area within the larger Sundarbans Tiger Preserve (established 1973), has an area of 514 square miles (1,330 square km). The combined entities occupy and protect a portion of India’s section of the Sundarbans region in the vast Padma (Ganges [Ganga])-Brahmaputra River delta shared by West Bengal and southern Bangladesh. The Sundarbans, containing the largest mangrove forest in the world, is home to a diverse range of aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals, many of them endangered or on the brink of extinction. Particularly notable is the region’s large population of Bengal tigers. The Sajnekhali area within the national park is a popular tourist destination, visitors coming to view its rich and varied birdlife. The park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 and was also included in a biosphere reserve established by UNESCO.</p>
    <h2>Flora</h2>
    <p>The number of plant species in swamps is few compared with the numbers that grow on well-watered but not waterlogged land. Cattails (Typha) and common reeds (Phragmites) are familiar swamp species around the world. Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus), a sedge, is widespread in the tropics. Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) is an example of a tree adapted to growth in swamps, but gums, willows (Salix), alders (Alnus), and maples (Acer) are also common. Tropical swamps have many tree species including palms.</p>
