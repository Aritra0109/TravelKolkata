    <h1><u>Siliguri</u></h1>
    <p>Siliguri, also spelled Shiliguri, city, northern West Bengal state, northeastern India. It lies just west of the Mahananda River.Siliguri is the terminus of the roads from Kalimpang (Kalimpong) and Sikkim and of road and rail connections with Darjiling (Darjeeling) and Jalpaiguri and is the hub for trade with Darjiling, Sikkim, and Tibet (China). Sawmilling and jute milling are important industries; there are also tea plantations in the vicinity. It was declared a municipality in 1931, and it has several colleges affiliated with the University of North Bengal (established 1962), the main campus of which is situated just west of the city. After partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan in 1947 and the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, the city became a crowded refugee centre. It has grown in strategic importance because of its proximity to international borders.</p>
    <h2>Siliguri Administration</h2>
    <p>The process of getting recognition for the potential of urban growth of Siliguri started in 1931 when it was made a non-municipal town and then declared as a municipal town in 1950. The total area of the Siliguri municipality was 15.54 sq. km. By 1994 it had been substantially increased to 41.90 sq. km and at the same time it was promoted to Siliguri Municipal Corporation.</p>

    <p>Most of Siliguri falls under the Darjeeling district, and is one of its subdivisions, while a minor part falls under Jalpaiguri district. In 1907, it received its sub-divisional status with four CD blocks; Matigara, Naxalbari, Phansidewa and Khoribari as well as the corporation area, Siliguri Municipal Corporation within its administrative jurisdiction.

    <h2>History of Siliguri</h2>
    <p>According to Sailen Debnath, an eminent scholar of the Dooars and Terai region, the term “Siliguri” means heap of pebbles or stones. It was often called “Shilchaguri” in the nineteenth century. It served as a transit point between Kurseong, Darjeeling hilly regions and Nepal till 1816 when the Treaty of Sagauli was made between Nepal and British India. From 1835, it started developing as a small town after the British seized Darjeeling and then the whole of Dooars as well as Kalimpong by the end of 1865.</p>
    <p>fter the independence and partition of India, and the creation of Bangladesh (originally East Pakistan), Siliguri became an indispensable strategic and transit point and led to large influx of immigrants to this commercially viable city. This population continues to increase to the present day with a culturally diverse group of people from Nepal, adjacent Indian states and southern Bhutan settling here.

    <h2>Geography and Climate</h2>
    <img src="https://im.hunt.in/cg/City-Guide/sunset-mahananda.jpg" alt="SS" height="400px" width="600px">
    <p>Siliguri is placed in the Siliguri Corridor, also known as a Chicken’s Neck corridor which is a narrow stretch of land which links the north eastern states of India with its mainland. Most of the city is in the Darjeeling district, though a small part lies in the neighbouring Jalpaiguri district. Siliguri is also the gateway to the hill stations of the east such as Darjeeling, Gangtok, Kalimpong, Mirik and Kurseong as well as North eastern hills of India due to its strategic location at the base of the Himalayan Mountains. It is divided by the River Mahananda into two halves while it is surrounded on almost all sides by extensive forests and hence is a favoured wild animal corridor. Siliguri has three main seasons, summer, monsoon and winter. The summers are hot with temperatures reaching 35 degree Celsius, while winters are chilly when temperatures fall down to 2 to 3 degree Celsius. Monsoons are characterized by moderate to heavy rainfall. For more on geography of Siliguri.</p>
